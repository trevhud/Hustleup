Hustleup
========

Hustleup is a Chrome extension that helps homeless individuals learn and make money on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

For those looking to help the homeless community by working on this open source project, please refer to bottom of this Readme for the current list of desired features.

Some things to note:

Many of the desired features alreadyexist as user scripts. These are JavaScript files that can be run in your browser using the Chrome extension Tamper Monkey.

The scripts were created by various people to make the mTurk experience better and are a great place to start when implementing new features.

So why create the extension? Why not just use the userscripts? User scripts have to be added individually, and adding 20+ scripts to each Hustleup participant's browser would be very tedious. More importantly, Temper Monkey loads the scripts from userscripts.org, a site that is very inconsistent and often goes down. At times, you can find the scripts on userscripts.org:8080, or userscripts-mirror.org, but with the changing availablity of these sites, it is impossible to provide a consistent experience for our users.

This is why we have chosen create a self-contained Chrome extension. We can add features one by one, using the existing scripts as a guide where applicable. The user scripts are in a folder called userscripts. Please push one integrated feature at a time after doing initial testing. We will install the current version on our participants' browsers and they will report if there are any issues.

Below is the feature list in order of importance.
Please check off features as they are added.
